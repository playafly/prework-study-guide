# <Prework Study Guide Project>

## Description

In an effort to learn about coding, this project was built to self teach about HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. The project is a study guide to help memorize and recognize the different mannerisms of the different languages. During this, I learned how to build a simple website using them to make it better to look at and easy to navigate.

## Usage

This study guide will select a random topic for you to study, and help memorize how different languages require different ways of structuring. It can also take advantage of the DevTools console to see how javascript is running.
